# CREDIT_CARD-FRAUD-DETECTION
HI, all.
THIS IS A MACHINE LEARNING MODEL TO PREDICT THE NO .OF VALID AND FRADUALENT CREDIT CARD FROM A VERY LARGE DATEST.
PREDICTION RESULT:
VALID: 100%
FRAUD: 2%
DATASET TAKEN FROM A RENOWN ONLINE PLATFORM.

ACCURACY=99.67% 
ACCURACY TO DETERMINE FRADUALENT TEST CASES COULD BE IMPROVED BY INCLUDING MORE TRAINING DATA AND TEST CASES HAVING EXAMPLES OF FRAUD CREDIT CARDS.

BY IMPLEMENTING SEVERAL METHODS OF ANOMALY DETECTION.

NOTE:- ONE VERSION OF PYTHON PACKAGE WAS OLD.

USED,READING DATA, DATA VISUALISATION ,DATA ANALYSIS AND OTHERS.


TRYING TO ACHIEVE HIGHER ACCURACY WITH LESS CODE. PLEASE TRY IF YOU CAN.
